Welcome!

Weâ€™re thrilled to have you join the coding waves Workshop! ðŸ˜Š In this tutorial, weâ€™ll guide you through the fascinating world of web technologies, revealing the different components that come together to create the web as we know it.
This journey may feel like an adventure into the unknown â€” but donâ€™t worry! Youâ€™ve already taken the brave first step by being here, and weâ€™re confident youâ€™ll do great.


Introduction

Have you ever felt like the world is becoming more tech-driven, but you're not quite there yet? Or maybe you've thought the world of software is just too complex to dive into on your own?

Well, weâ€™ve got some great news for you! Programming isnâ€™t as daunting as it seems, and weâ€™re here to show you just how fun it can be.

This tutorial wonâ€™t instantly make you a programmer â€” but thatâ€™s okay! Becoming skilled in this field takes time, practice, and patience. What we aim to do is show you that programming and website creation arenâ€™t as complicated as they might appear. Weâ€™ll break things down into manageable pieces so that you wonâ€™t feel overwhelmed.

We hope to spark a Love for Tech in you, just like it did for us!


What you will learn from this workshop?

By the end of this workshop, youâ€™ll have created a small, functional web application, one step at a time!

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
